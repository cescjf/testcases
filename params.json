The simulations are then run in parallel.\r\nA pyhthon script compares the results and writes them into a .csv-file. These results are then plotted as .eps-file by another python script\r\n\r\n## Scripts\r\nEach folder contains the following scripts\r\n * deletefolders.sh\r\n * genfolders.sh\r\n * runall.sh\r\n * calc.py\r\n * plot.py\r\n \r\nThe scripts are meant to be called in that order.\r\n\r\n### deletefolder.sh\r\nThis script deletes possible remnats of previous simulations. It only leaves the template folders intact.\r\n\r\n## genfolders.sh\r\nThis script creates the actual simulation folders out of the template folders.\r\nFor the manual SA, several folders are created that differ only by the stepsize for the final difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n## runall.sh\r\nThis script runs all calculations on the newly created folders in parallel.\r\n\r\n## calc.py\r\nThis script creates .csv-files for both the manual and analytic sensitivity analysis. For the manual SA oit also calculates the central difference.\r\n\r\n## plot.py\r\nThis script plots the results for the manual and analytic SA for camparison. The plots are saved as .eps-file.\r\n",
